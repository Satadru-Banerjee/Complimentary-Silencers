# HackTheCrisis
A simple model using Genetic Algorithm which takes in the RNA sequence of Covid-19 virus and that of our vaccine and predicts the time taken to eliminate the virus.
It takes in 4 parameters --
vrna (RNA Sequence of the Virus)
vacrna (RNA Sequence of the Vaccine)
popsize (Viral RNA count + Vaccine RNA Count)
alpha (Viral RNA count=alpha*popsize Vaccine RNA Count=(1-alpha)*popsize)
